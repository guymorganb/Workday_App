# Workday_App
## Description

- This document was created to be used as a learning opportuniy for using JavaScript to dynamically update the page, and to leanr how to properly incorporate BootStap styles.

- This page was created to serve as a generic workday scheduler can be dynamically altered through just changing some initial values, so its hours can be set longer or shorter depending on user needs.

- This project solves the problem of needing to demonstrate the ability to use JavaScript to dynamically update and manage the page along with dynamically updating the page with BootStrap.

- I was able to expand my knowleged of JavaScript after having been coding for only 5 months, Ive been learning how it can be applied to the working needs of a user. I was also able to understand the level of detail that goes into even something this simple.
