# Workday_App
## Description

- This document was created to be used as a learning opportuniy for using JavaScript to dynamically update the page, and to leanr how to properly incorporate BootStap styles.

- This page was created to serve as a generic workday scheduler can be dynamically altered through just changing some initial values, so its hours can be set longer or shorter depending on user needs.

- This project solves the problem of needing to demonstrate the ability to use JavaScript to dynamically update and manage the page along with dynamically updating the page with BootStrap.

- I was able to expand my knowleged of JavaScript after having been coding for only 5 months, Ive been learning how it can be applied to the working needs of a user. I was also able to understand the level of detail that goes into even something this simple.

## Installation

This webpage can be navigated to and acessed with a browser. It does not require installation.

## Usage

- This page should be used for learning and demonstration purposes.

- To engage this document: 

1) First the user must click on either, the Start button to start the Quiz, or the View High Scores option at the top, to insect scores stored in their local storage.

2) Please note: Your local storage will be accessed*

3) If View High Scores is selected, the stored information in local browser storage will be populated to the screen. Any quiz scores that have been stored will be filtered and paired up accordingly.

4) If the Start button is selected, the Quiz will begin, there are 6 questions in this quiz, and the user will socre points for each correct answer, and be penalized time for each wrong answer.

5) If time expires the Quiz will redirect to the final page

6) Upon completing the Quiz, the user will be prompted to enter their initials, which will be stored in local storage.

7) When viewing high scores, the user can clear the scores, which will empty their local storage, thus removing the saved scores.

8) At this point the Quiz is over, and the "go back" button can be used to start the quiz over.

9) Although I did not see this issue listed as part of the assignment criteria, Its worth noting, that if the user is in the middle of the quiz, and decides to View High Scores, it will trigger duplice elements being created, but the user will still be able to enter their score if they let the time expire. If any occurance like this occurs, clicking the "go back" button will reset the quiz.
